    <h3>My life is really balanced with traveling, hiking, and family. I find each of these to be fun and it is what keeps me
    happy and smiling in my everyday life. </h3>
    
    <p>Traveling is something I wanted to do since a child. Watching tv with my family and seeing lifestyles of other families
    has caught my interest from early on. I wanted to visit and see how people live their life around the world. So, now as
    an adult, I am fortunate enough to visit a handful of countries. It has strengthened the love I have for people and
    diversity. It was so much more that what I used to see in the television as a kid.</p>
   
    <p>
    As I traveled one thing I tried to do as often as I can is to hike. It gives me great joy to see nature and exercise
    while at it. Although I have hiked majority of the mountains near where I live, I was still able to hike in cool places
    like Greece and Ethiopia.
